<em>Synopsis:</em> Batman, Lt. Gordon and DA Harvey Dent have become a very efficient team and they dealt some major blows to Gotham's underworld. But now Batman gets a new class of enemy: The Joker. The Joker has no plan, he has no goal beside causing havoc and creating chaos. And he's very good at what he does. But can he force Batman to cross the line?

<em>My Opinion:</em> A great continuation to the great first movie. I always liked the first two <em>Batman</em> movies and I never really liked the cheesy third and especially fourth movie. Although I've never read any <em>Batman</em> comic I've always felt that it had to be dark and dirty and sometimes morally grey. Batman is no bright character for me. And although it had many comic elements in it <em>Batman Begins</em> felt very realistic. And <em>The Dark Knight</em> is the perfect sequel. It continues where the first movie left off - and I love the Joker. When he first told the story about how he got the scars I thought they were going to blew it and then was relieved when he then told yet another - totally different - story and thus remained his mysteriousness. But to be perfectly honest, I had expected that the "good people" on the ferry would pull the trigger. And then have themselves blown up. That would be totally in the line of Joker's thinking IMHO. If I were to give stars, what I rarely do, I'd give 9.5 out of 10.
